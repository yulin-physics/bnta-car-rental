## Introduction
This is a command line car rental and car management system.
There are two types of target users:
1. Car rental for customers, booking and returning cars are possible
2. Car management for the business, adding and removing cars are possible
   1. Adding a new car: prompts for car model and daily rental price, car model must be one from the CarsMake Enum
   2. Removing an existing car: prompts for car ID
   3. Show Available cars
   4. Show rented cars

All data are saved onto the file:
```
rentalDB.csv
```
and PostgreSQL database. The switch between the two through the interface is yet to be implemented.


You can add new cars, remove cars, make changes directly to the csv file instead of the using the command line interface.
The changes will be reflected in the car rental part of the CLI.
